  Runtime Architectural Protocol as defined in PI Specification VOLUME 2 DXE

  Allows the runtime functionality of the DXE Foundation to be contained
  in a separate driver. It also provides hooks for the DXE Foundation to
  export information that is needed at runtime. As such, this protocol allows
  services to the DXE Foundation to manage runtime drivers and events.
  This protocol also implies that the runtime services required to transition
  to virtual mode, SetVirtualAddressMap() and ConvertPointer(), have been
  registered into the UEFI Runtime Table in the UEFI System Table. This protocol
  must be produced by a runtime DXE driver and may only be consumed by the DXE Foundation.
