  EFI_USB2_HC_PROTOCOL as defined in UEFI 2.0.
  The USB Host Controller Protocol is used by code, typically USB bus drivers,
  running in the EFI boot services environment, to perform data transactions over
  a USB bus. In addition, it provides an abstraction for the root hub of the USB bus.

    Submits isochronous transfer to an isochronous endpoint of a USB device.

    This function is used to submit isochronous transfer to a target endpoint of a USB device.
    The target endpoint is specified by DeviceAddressand EndpointAddress. Isochronous transfers are
    used when working with isochronous date. It provides periodic, continuous communication between
    the host and a device. Isochronous transfers can beused only by full-speed, high-speed, and
    super-speed devices.

    High-speed isochronous transfers can be performed using multiple data buffers. The number of
    buffers that are actually prepared for the transfer is specified by DataBuffersNumber. For
    full-speed isochronous transfers this value is ignored.

    Data represents a list of pointers to the data buffers. For full-speed isochronous transfers
    only the data pointed by Data[0]shall be used. For high-speed isochronous transfers and for
    the split transactions depending on DataLengththere several data buffers canbe used. For the
    high-speed isochronous transfers the total number of buffers must not exceed EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM.

    For split transactions performed on full-speed device by high-speed host controller the total
    number of buffers is limited to EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM1.
    If the isochronous transfer is successful, then EFI_SUCCESSis returned. The isochronous transfer
    is designed to be completed within one USB frame time, if it cannot be completed, EFI_TIMEOUT
    is returned. If an error other than timeout occurs during the USB transfer, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR
    is returned and the detailed status code will be returned in TransferResult.

  /**
    Submits nonblocking isochronous transfer to an isochronous endpoint of a USB device.

    This is an asynchronous type of USB isochronous transfer. If the caller submits a USB
    isochronous transfer request through this function, this function will return immediately.

    When the isochronous transfer completes, the IsochronousCallbackfunction will be triggered,
    the caller can know the transfer results. If the transfer is successful, the caller can get
    the data received or sent in this callback function.

    The target endpoint is specified by DeviceAddressand EndpointAddress. Isochronous transfers
    are used when working with isochronous date. It provides periodic, continuous communication
    between the host and a device. Isochronous transfers can be used only by full-speed, high-speed,
    and super-speed devices.

    High-speed isochronous transfers can be performed using multiple data buffers. The number of
    buffers that are actually prepared for the transfer is specified by DataBuffersNumber. For
    full-speed isochronous transfers this value is ignored.

    Data represents a list of pointers to the data buffers. For full-speed isochronous transfers
    only the data pointed by Data[0] shall be used. For high-speed isochronous transfers and for
    the split transactions depending on DataLength there several data buffers can be used. For
    the high-speed isochronous transfers the total number of buffers must not exceed EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM.

    For split transactions performed on full-speed device by high-speed host controller the total
    number of buffers is limited to EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM1.

    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned if one of the following conditionsis satisfied:
      - Data is NULL.
      - DataLength is 0.
      - DeviceSpeed is not one of the supported values listed above.
      - MaximumPacketLength is invalid. MaximumPacketLength must be 1023 or less for full-speed
        devices and 1024 or less for high-speed and super-speed devices.
